# About me
Immersed in computers technologies since my youngest age, I've quickly had the opportunity to make a hobby from it and to use my free time to learn even more about computers.

At the age of 12, I was already creating my first website using a WYSIWYG software and, few years later, with the help of web technologies like HTML and CSS.

In 2009, I finally decided to make software development my job. It's why I started in august 2009 an apprenticeship at the ETML (Technical school, Work school of the city of Lausanne).  In July 2013, I successfully finished my initial studies.

Now in possession of a Federal Certificate of Proficiency in computer science as well as a technical maturity, I intend to go further by obtaining a Bachelor in Software Engineering. Thatâ€™s why I've started in September 2014 a new course of study at the HEIG-VD.

In parallel of my studies and work experiences, I had the opportunity to form myself to different technologies. It's by this way that I've learned to understand and masteries mobile development on the most used platforms.
